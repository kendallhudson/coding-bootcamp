<!-- INSTRUCTIONS

The goal here is relatively simple:

Use headings (h1, h2, etc) for the title, and headings for different sections
Apply some very basic styling to the body element (change the background color, choose a font, maybe set a max-width to prevent the text from being too long)
Use unordered and ordered lists for the ingredients and directions
Use paragraphs as necessary
Avoid using div or span elements unless there is no better semantic tag available
To accomplish this:

Write all your code inside recipe.html
Save often
Use "Go Live" from the Live Server extension to see your changes
Add this to the head tag, replacing the X, Y, and Zs with some valid values

        This is not a quick recipe, but the results are worth it. I usually take an entire Saturday to make this, but most of the time it's simmering on the stove, so it's not labor intensive. Chicken bones browned with celery, onions and carrots make this broth dark and rich. I freeze leftover rotisserie chicken bones and make this about once a month or so. I freeze the stock in quart bags and use one whenever I would use chicken broth.

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Pour olive oil into the bottom of a large roasting pan; top with chicken carcass pieces, carrots, onions, and celery.</li>
                <li>Roast in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until bones and vegetables are browned, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Transfer roasted chicken bones and vegetables to an 8-quart stockpot. Pour wine into the roasting pan, scraping the bottom to release any browned bits of food; pour into stockpot. Add peppercorns, cloves, bay leaves, and thyme to stockpot. Cover the mixture with water and bring to a slow simmer. Set heat to low and simmer, straining off fat as needed, for at least 5 hours. Strain stock through a cheesecloth; refrigerate or freeze stock.</li>
