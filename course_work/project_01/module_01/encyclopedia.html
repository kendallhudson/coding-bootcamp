            Mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes and patterns. The word comes from the Greek μάθημα (máthema), meaning "science, knowledge, or learning", and is sometimes shortened to maths (in British Commonwealth countries) or math (in North America).

        <h3>Mathematics includes the study of:</h3>

        <p><b>Numbers: </b>how things can be counted</p>
        <p><b>Structure: </b>how things are organized. This subfield is usually called algebra.</p>
        <p><b>Place: </b>where things are are and their arrangement. This subfield is usually called geometry.</p>
        <p><b>Change: </b>how things become different. This subfield is usually called analysis.</p>
        <p>
            Applied math is useful for solving problems in the real world, so many people besides mathematicians study and use mathematics. Today, some mathematics is needed in many jobs. People working in business, science, engineering, and construction use mathematics.
